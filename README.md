<h1>Tenable Nessus Essentials Vulnerability Management Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a walkthrough of how I created A Virtual Machine environment using Oracle VM Virtualbox running Windows 11. I did this project to gain experience with Nessus Essentials and learn how to scan for vulnerabilities and remediate them. This project will showcase the first two steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle identification and prioritization. I will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on Oracle VM Virtualbox in order to run a non-credentialed scan to discover and analyze vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation.

The first step that I took for this home lab was Downloaded Tenable Nessus Essentials which is a vlunerability scanner and management software. <br/>

<br />
<br />
As a requirement for the virtual machine, I must install an Operating System. I chose to download and configure Windows 11 onto the virtual machine.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Oracle VM virtual Box is the virtual machine that I will download, configure, and manage the vulnerabilities. I have to configure the network adapter to be bridged so it can be on the same network as the native host. I do this because Nessus has to Secure Server Login (SSL) into the Virtual Machine and it's just easier if it's using my local network. Furthermore, to troubleshoot the "Not in a hypervisor position (hvp=0) (verr_nem_not_available)" error I had to restart my computer, configure the BIOS settings to enable Virtualization Technology. <br/>

<br />
<br /> 
To run the vulnerability scan, as a priliminary step I disabled the domain, public, and private firewalls on the native host.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
I utilized the Command Prompt (CMD) to figure out the IP address of the Virtual Machine, which I will need to run vulnerability scans on Nessus. The output of the Ipconfig command shows that the IP address for the virtual machine is 10.0.0.87.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The screenshot below displays the attempt of trying to ping the VM in the Command Prompt from my native computer to see if I can communicate with the VM. If the ping is unsuccessful, this can insinuate that Nessus won't be able to scan the VM as well. As we can see the pings are timing out, meaning my native PC can't establish a connection with it at the moment.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The reason the native host can not establish a connection is because the VM has a firewall active and it is blocking all connection attempts. In a producation environment it is highly recommneded that all firewalls are active, but for the purpose of this lab I have to disable the firewalls on the Domain Profile, Private Profile, and the Public Profile.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
After disabling the firewall, I performed the ping scan again on the native host and this time it was successful. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Once the VM is configured to allow communication, the next stwp is to start a new scan with Nessus Essentials.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The below screensot displays the configuration for the scan. I configured it to scan the VM's IP address which is 10.0.0.87. I then successfuly launched the scan in which the checkmark signifies that the scan is complete. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now it is time to review the results of the scan. It is showing 26 results, 25 of which are labeled info and 1 as medium risk. The next step is to analyze the scan report to grasp an understanding of the risk posture of the VM. Tenable Nessus 
Essentials uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) to quantify the risk and urgency of a vulnerability. A serverity level of Info, Low, Medium, High, or Critical is assigned to each vulnerability. For the 25 vulnerabilities that were categorized as info, the plugin's vulnerability CVSSv2 score is 0, and for the 1 vulnerability that was categorized as mediium has a CVSSv2 score of 5.3.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
To further analyze the Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol vulnerability, I was able to discover that the reason for this trigger was because Nessus failed to authenticate to the remote service using the provided credentials. This is a result of not providing credentials for this scan. <br />
