<h1>Tenable Nessus Essentials Vulnerability Management Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a walkthrough of how I created A Virtual Machine environment using Oracle VM Virtualbox running Windows 11. I did this project to gain experience with Nessus Essentials and learn how to scan for vulnerabilities and remediate them. This project will showcase the first two steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle identification and prioritization. I will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on Oracle VM Virtualbox in order to run non-credentialed scans to discover and analyze vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation.

Download, configure, and troubleshoot errors for Oracle VM virtual Box - For the Virtual Machine that I will be managing vulnerabilities on, I have to configure the network adapter to be bridged so it can be on the same network as my native. I do this because Nessus has to Secure Server Login (SSL) into the Virtual Machine and it's just easier if it's using my local network.: <br/>

Disable domain, public, and private firewalls:  <br/>

<br />
Opened  the command Prompt CMD to figure out it's IP address which I will need to be able to run vulnerability scans on Nessus. The screenshot shows that the IP address is 10.0.0.87:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
I try to ping the VM in the command prompt from my native computer to see if I can communicate with the VM. The reason I am doing this is because if I can't ping the VM then Nessus won't be able to as well and can't run its scans. As we can see the pings are timing out, meaning my native PC can't establish a connection with it at the moment.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The reason my PC can't establish a connection is because the VM has a firewall active and it is blocking all connection attempts (which is a good thing, but not for the purposes of this lab) so I have to disable the firewalls on the Domain Profile, Private Profile, and the Public Profile. This is something I would NEVER do in a production environment as it could and would be catastrophic, but this is just a junk VM so no worries.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now that the VM's firewall is disabled, I try to Ping it again from my native PC and this time it is successful.: <br/>
